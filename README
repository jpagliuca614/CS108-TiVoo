XML Parsing: Andrew and Tianyu
Filtering: James
HTML Output: Donghe

Part 1:
	Parser is able to parser three different types of calendars (GoogelCal, DukeCal, .ics Cal)
	Cannot fully parse GoogleCal jsut yet (having trouble with "Recurring Event" cases)
	Other calendars are fully parsable
	Code is very ugly, please don't look at it if you don't have too, we will refactor later

	Filter works by filtering by keyword in title or by Dates
	It is kind of a hassle to filter by Dates because then you have to actually set up the
		proper Date objects
	
	HTML.java outputs two types of HTML files: an HTML table and HTML pages for specific events
	The table contains the events arranged by the days of their occurrences and links to the
		event specific HTML pages
