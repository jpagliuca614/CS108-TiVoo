<description>Description: Jummah is held every Friday at 12:45 PM in York Room during the "academic year". This is the primary service for Duke students. The York Room is located in Gray building on the second floor of the Divinity School Library. It is accessible by entering the Divinity School Library from the first floor, or from a separate entry on the second floor. After prayer services, the community gathers together to socialize over lunch offered by Muslim Life at Duke. Jummah on West is a wonderful way to catch up with friends and meet new members to the Duke Muslim community.
