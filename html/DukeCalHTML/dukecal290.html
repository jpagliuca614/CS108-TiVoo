<description>Description: Celebrate the season with a story read aloud outside in the Gardens. Each story relates to the season or garden spot. Let's read together and then discuss the garden connection. Please go to gardens.duke.edu the Monday before class to see an announcement of the book to be read that week. For children ages 5-8, adult chaperone required. No pre-registration required, and no capacity limits. Duke Gardens: 420 Anderson St.<br /></description>
