<description>Description: Students interested in participating in the second annual Duke Law Weekend-in-DC, held October 21-22 in conjunction with Equal Justice Works (EJW), should attend to find out about registration (which is separate from EJW registration), alumni speakers, and networking opportunities. In addition to the EJW conference, the weekend includes an alumni reception on Friday evening and a Saturday afternoon session with 15 alumni speakers hosted by Hogan Lovells. Last year, 60 students participated in Saturday's session, which focused on job opportunities in federal government agencies, Capitol Hill, and advocacy organizations. Lunch will be served.
