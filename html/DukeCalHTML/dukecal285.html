<description>Description: Take an early morning stroll through the Gardens with a bird expert Cynthia Fox, of Chapel Hill's Wild Bird Center, who can help you learn to recognize birds by song and sight. Over the past several years, we have had some amazing sightings, including a handsome magnolia warbler, the migrating Swainson's thrush and the secretive yellow-billed cuckoo. Meet fellow birders as you treat yourself to a birding excursion. Duke Gardens: 420 Anderson St.<br /></description>
