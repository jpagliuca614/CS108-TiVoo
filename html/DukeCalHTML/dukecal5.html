<description>Description: Rabbi Marshall Meyer was an ordinary man whose extraordinary convictions, faith, and impetuous personality impelled him to become one of the most important human rights activists during ArgentinaÂ¿s Dirty War (1976-1983). This exhibit commemorates Meyer's human rights work and also explores the making of an activist. The exhibit will also be on display in the Duke Divinity School October 4-December 18.<br /></description>
