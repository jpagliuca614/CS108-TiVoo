<description>Description: CMOS technology has served as the foundation of modern electronics over the last 40 years. Relentless technology scaling has been the main growth engine in the semiconductor industry, bringing ever-increasing performance to the end-user while lowering product power and cost. But the miniaturization of CMOS transistors has led to increasing difficulties in achieving robust circuit design to meet high-volume manufacturing requirements as the feature size of the transistor is scaled down to the nano-regime.
