Catholics at Duke celebrate Mass on Sunday mornings at 11am in White Lecture Hall on East Campus and on Sunday nights (when classes are in session) at 9pm in Duke Chapel. The Duke Catholic Center sponsors retreats, socials, service projects and other activities to provide Catholic students with opportunities for fellowship, prayer, learning and fun.
